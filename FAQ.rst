Where does the name come from?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The Hebrew word *Caspi* (כספי) means "financial" or "my money".


Why don't you just use GnuCash?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Because I can't help myself.

I'm very inspired by GnuCash, which I used for a few years.  There's a bit
of NIH_ involved, I admit, but I think the feature set is somewhat
different.  Also I think I'm more likely to actually use the software if I
have another vested interest in it.
